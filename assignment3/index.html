        <!-- Description-->
            <p>Pizza was invented 6 thousand years after Christ, mixing flour and water by the Egyptians.
            The Egyptian recipe has touched diverse civilizations throughout history.
            The Greeks, decided to put the wheat flour with rice and bake it on hot bricks.
            The Phoenicians, however, had the idea of adding onions and meats over this mass.
            In the beginning only some herbs and oil was added to pizza, since it was a cheap food intended to the pour people.
            And it was in Naples, the city considered as the birthplace of pizza, that the first rounded pizza was developed.
            At that time, they were also added tomato, bacon, fried fish and cheese as a topping.
            The famous Margherita pizza has ben developed in Naples too, and it was created to honor King Umberto I and Queen Margherita,
            symbolizing the Italian flag colors (white, red and green).</p>
            <p>Pizza has become a universal food, with a variety of flavors, all around the world.</p>
            <p>Pizza arrived in Brazil with the Italian Immigrants arround 1870, most of them located in Sao Paulo,
            and until 1950 it was restricted to Italians. At that time, it was spread all over the country and in 10th June, Brazil celebrate “Pizza day”.
            Brazil also create a dessert pizza. Fruits, chocolate, Nutella, cream cheese and even ice cream are toppings uses.</p>
            <p>Pizza arrived in Canada around 1950, with the first ovens. In 1960s it gained popularity across the country.
            It’s served in restaurants, but also in fast-food. The flavors are “Canadian” pizza, prepared with tomato sauce,
            cheese, mushroom and bacon, these las two ingredients are the most stand out in Canada.</p>
